# qwasi_code

### Intro

This is a easy page to show how to implement qwasi api to sign up and send "hello world" message to user.

### Usage

Use XAMPP to load it on local machine.
if user just want to send a SMS. He could just fill the phone row and press send SMS button.

### Most challenging thing 

Regex part and parsing XML part were most challenging things I dealt with. It took me pretty long time to figure out how to receive the right message I wanted.
